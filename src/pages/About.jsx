              A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by
              cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or
              double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized
              networks using blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced
              by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of
              cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any
              central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to
              government interference or manipulation.
